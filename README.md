# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

Project is designed to Create a new User, allow me to create their own hikes, edit exisiting hikes, delete exisiting hikes, and see all    Trails created in the Database! I was inspired to do this while in Hawai'i recently, and enjoyed so many wonderful hikes seeing the beautiful mountains of the island, the water-colored sea, beautiful views, and amazing adrenaline going through my veins as I take this all in. That's was inspired me to do this for anyone wanting to keep track of their hikes while in Hawai'i!
